### Simple CMS for adding, viewing, editing and deleting student presentations 

See [demo](https://presentation-app-integrify.herokuapp.com)

Created using React, Redux, Node, MongoDB...

- I used several technologies and principles that are new to me:
    * Node
    * Express
    * MongoDB
    * Mongoose
    * axios

- and just to get familiar:
    * Bootstrap
    * Sass
    * BEM naming style
    * classNames
